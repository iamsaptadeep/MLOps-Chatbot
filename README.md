## MLOps Pipeline

This project implements a full MLOps workflow:

1. Data Versioning using DVC
2. Experiment Tracking using MLflow
3. Model Training with Sentence Transformers
4. Artifact Management
5. API Deployment (FastAPI)
6. Monitoring and Retraining (Planned)

### Version Control
- Git: source code
- DVC: datasets and models
- MLflow: experiments and metrics
